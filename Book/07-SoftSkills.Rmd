# Soft Skills for Data Scientists

## Comparison between Statistician and Data Scientist

Statistics as a scientific area can be traced back to 1749 and statistician as a career has been around for hundreds of years with well-established theory and application. Data Scientist becomes an attractive career for only a few years along with the fact that data size and variety beyond the traditional statistician’s toolbox and the fast growing of computation power. Statistician and data scientist have a lot of common backgrounds, but there are also some significant differences.

Both statistician and data scientist work closely with data. For the traditional statistician, the data is usually well-formatted text files with numbers and labels. The size of the data usually can be fitted in a PC’s memory. Comparing to statisticians, data scientists need to deal with more varieties of data: well-formatted data stored in a database system with size much larger than a PC’s memory or hard-disk; huge amount of verbatim text, voice, image, and video; real-time streaming data and other types of records. One particular power of statistics is that statistician can fit model and make an inference based on limited data. It is quite common that once the data is given and cleaned, the majority of the work is developed different models around the data. Today, data is relatively abundant, and modeling is just part of the overall effort. The focus is to deliver actionable results. Different from statisticians, data scientists, sometimes need to fit model on the cloud instead of reading data in since the data size is too large. From the entire problem-solving cycle, statisticians are usually not well integrated with the production system where data is obtained in real time; while data scientists are more embedded in the production system and closer to the data generation procedures. 

## Where Data Science Team Fits?

During the past decade, a huge amount of data has become available and readily accessible for analysis in many companies across different business sectors. The size, complexity, and speed of increment of data suddenly beyond the traditional scope of statistical analysis or BI reporting as mentioned above. To leverage the big data, many companies have established new data science organizations. Companies have gone through different paths to create their own data science and machine learning organizations. There are three major formats of data science teams: 

(1) independent of any current organizations and the team report directly to senior leadership;   
(2) within each business unit and the team report to business unit leaders;    
(3) within in the traditional IT organizations and the team report to IT leaders.

Companies are different in many aspects, but in general, the most efficient option to mine big data is a team of data scientist independent of business units and IT organizations. The independence enables the data science team to collaborate across business units and IT organizations more efficiently and the independence also provides flexibility and potential to solve corporate level strategic big data problems. For each business units, there are many business unit specific data science related problems and embedding data scientist within each business units is also an efficient way to solve business unit specific data science problems. The full cycle of data science projects from data to decision (i.e. Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Insight -> Decision) is relatively difficult to achieve if the data science team is part of traditional IT organizations. 

## Beyond Data and Analytics

Data scientists usually have a good sense of data and analytics, but data scientist project is definitely more than just data and analytics. A data science project may involve people with many different roles:  

- a business owner or leader to identify opportunities in business value; program managers to ensure each data science project fit into the overall technical program development; 
- data owners and computation resource and infrastructure owners from IT department; 
- dedicated team to make sure the data and model are under model governance and privacy guidelines; 
- a team to implement, maintain and refresh the model;
- project managers to coordinate all parties to set periodical tasks so that the project meets the preset milestones and delivery results; 
- multiple rounds of discussion of resource allocation (i.e. who will pay for the data science project). 

Effective communication and in-depth domain knowledge about the business problem are essential requirements for a successful data scientist. A data scientist will interact with people at various levels ranging from senior leaders who are setting the corporate strategies to front line employees who are doing the daily work. A data scientist needs to have the capability to view the problem from 10,000 feet above ground, as well as down to the detail to the very bottom. To convert a business question into a data problem, a data scientist needs to communicate using the language the other people can understand and obtain the required information. 

## Data Scientist as a Leader

During the entire process of data science project defining, planning, executing and implementation, the data scientist lead needs to be involved in every step to ensure the business problem is defined correctly and the business value and success metric are evaluated reasonable. Corporates are investing heavily in data science and machine learning with a very high expectation of big return. There are too many opportunities to introduce unrealistic goal and business impact for a particular data science project. The leading data scientist need to be the leader in these discussions to define the goal backed by data and analytics. Many data science projects over promise in deliverables and too optimistic on the timeline and these projects eventually fail by not delivering the preset business impact within the timeline. As the data scientist in the team, we need to identify these issues early in the stage and communicate to the entire team to make sure the project has a realistic deliverable and timeline. The data scientist team also need to work closely with data owners to identify relevant internal and external data source and evaluate the quality of the data; as well as working closely with the computation infrastructure team to understand the computation resources (i.e. hardware and software) available for the data science project.

## Three Pillars of Knowledge

The following picture summarizes the needed three pillars of knowledge to be a successful data scientist. 

(1) A successful data scientist needs to have a strong technical background in data mining, statistics and machine learning. The in-depth understanding of modeling with the insight about data enable a data scientist to convert a business problem to a data science problem. 

(2) A successful data scientist needs some domain knowledge to understand business problem. For any data science project, the data scientist need to collaborate with other team members and effective communication and leadership skills are critical, especially when you are the only data person in the room and you need to make a decision with uncertainty. 

(3) The last pillar is about computation environment and model implementation in big data platform. This used to be the most difficult one for a data scientist with statistics background (i.e. lack computer science or programming skills). The good news is that with the rise of cloud computation big data platform, this barrier is getting easier for a statistician to overcome and we will discuss in more detail in next chapter.

## Common Pitfalls of Data Science Projects

Data science projects are usually complicated in nature, and many of these data science projects eventually fail due to various reasons. We will briefly discuss a few common pitfalls in data science projects and how to avoid them.

- **Solve the wrong problem:** data science project usually starts with a very vague description and a few rounds of detailed discussion with all stakeholders involved are needed to define the busses problem. There will be lots of opportunities to introduce misalignment when mapping the business problem into specific data science methods. Especially when the quality and availability of the data are not as good as what is expected at the first place. If not well-communicated during the project, the final data science solution may not be the right one to solve the business problem. As the data scientist (sometimes the only data scientist) in the room, we must understand the business problem thoroughly and communicate regularly to business partners especially there is a change of status to make sure everyone is aligned with the progress and final deliverables.

- **Over promise on business value:** business leaders usually have high expectation on data science projects and the goal of business value and deliverables sometimes are set unrealistic and eventually beyond the scope of available data and computation resource.  As the data scientist (sometimes the only data scientist) in the room, we must have our voice heard based on fact (i.e. data, analytics, and resources) instead of wishful thinking. Backed with fact-based evidence, it is easier to communicate what is a realistic goal for the entire team. 

- **Too optimistic about the timeline:** there are lots of uncertainties in data science projects such as the data source availability and data quality, computation hardware and software, resource availability in the business team, implementation team and IT department, as well as project direction change which may delay the final delivery date. To have a better-estimated timeline, get as much detail as possible for all the needed tasks and estimated each task individually and reach out to each team member to confirm their availability. Most importantly, communicate with the entire team if there are blocking factors for the project in a prompt way such that everyone aware of the situation and potential impact on the timeline.

- **Too optimistic about data availability and quality:** the most important asset in data science project is data. Even though we are at the big data age, often times there is not enough relevant data for the data science projects. The data quality is also a general problem for data science projects. A thorough data availability and quality check are needed at the beginning of the data science project to estimate the needed effort to obtain data as well as data cleaning. 

- **Model cannot be scaled:**  be careful if you use a subset of data to fit the model and then scale it to the entire dataset. When developing the model using a smaller dataset, we must keep in mind how much computation resources needed for the whole dataset. With limited computation resource, it is important to maximize the computation time in production to a reasonable level based on the business application when fits the model with a sample dataset. 

- **Take too long to fail:** data science projects usually are trying to push the boundary of current applications to new territory, people do not expect all data science projects to be successful. Fail fast is generally good practice such that we can quickly find a better way to solve the problem. A data scientist needs to have an open mindset to not stuck with one idea or one approach for a long time to avoid taking too long to fail.
