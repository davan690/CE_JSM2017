## R Markdown

- Example: [EX1_Markdown.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happyrabbit/linhui.org/gh-pages/CE_JSM2017/Examples/EX1_Markdown.Rmd)([output](http://scientistcafe.com/CE_JSM2017/Examples/EX1_Markdown.html))

- Markdown: lightweight markup language designed to make authoring content easy for everyone

- R + Markdown = R Markdown

- How It Works?

## Markdown Basic - Paragraphs, Headers

```pre
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

A First Level Header
=====================

A Second Level Header
---------------------
```

## Markdown Basic - Paragraphs, Headers

```{r, out.width = "500px",out.height = "350px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://scientistcafe.com/CE_JSM2017/images/headermd.PNG")
```

## Markdown Basic - Blockquotes

```pre
A statistician gave birth to twins, but only had one of them baptised. 
She kept the other as a control.

News bulletin: A local Physicist declared that he has figured out the ingredients in
McDonald’s secret sauce: protons, nuetrons, and electrons.

> All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence, 
and then success is sure. [Mark Twain]
> 
> A bartender says, “We don’t serve faster than light particles in here.” 
A tachyon walks into a bar. [A joke from Prof. Bill Rand]
```

## Markdown Basic - Phrase Emphasis

```pre
Some of these words *are italic*.
Some of these words _are italic also_.

Use two asterisks for **bold**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Markdown Basic - Lists

```pre
* If it’s green and wiggles, it’s biology.
* If it stinks, it’s chemistry.
* If it doesn’t work, it’s Physics.

```pre
An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician were on a train heading north, and had
just crossed the border into Scotland.

- The engineer looked out of the window and said “Look! Scottish sheep are black!”
- The physicist said, “No, no. Some Scottish sheep are black.”
- The mathematician looked irritated. “There is at least one field, containing at
least one sheep, of - which at least one side is black.”
- The statistician : “It’s not significant. We only know there’s one black sheep”
- The computer scientist : “Oh, no! A special case!”

- `collapsed` (defaults to `TRUE`)
- `smooth_scroll` (defaults to `TRUE`)

## Code Chunks

- start with ` ```{r} ` and end with ` ``` `
- keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
- Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar

</center>

## Customize Chunks

- `include = FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
- `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
- `message = FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
- `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
- `fig.height`, `fig.width` The width and height to use in R for plots created by the chunk (in inches).
