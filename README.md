# CE_JSM2017
The science and art of data

# To do:

Priority 1:

- Add reference [Ming's piece is done, no addtianl reference for Ming's park]
- ~~change links for data/files~~
- Problem with compiling pdf (ask Yihui)
- ~~Learning outcome~~ [Ming's comment: Learning outcome needs to be shown before and after the CE material]
- ~~Summary of algorithms~~
- ~~Rewrite Data Preprocessing~~
- ~~Update data science survey results~~
- Add jokes
- ~~Markdown basics~~
- Double check the description of deep learning: The name is a little misleading. As mentioned before, it is multilayer neural network. It is hyped tremendously especially after AlphaGO defeated Li Shishi. Many of the deep learning algorithms are semi-supervised learning algorithms that deal with large data sets with a few unlabeled samples. 
- ~~I --> we (Ming, can you check this?)~~ [Ming have check every sections]
