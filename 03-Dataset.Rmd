# Introduction to the data

Before tackling analytics problem, we start by creating data to be analyzed in later chapters. Why do we simulate data instead of using real data set?  

- Going through the simulation code helps you practice R skills. 
- It makes the book less dependent on downloading online data sets.
- It allows you manipulate the synthetic data, run analysis and examine how the results change.
- The authors do not need to worry about intellectual property rights.

## Customer Data for Clothing Company

Our first data set represents customers of a clothing company who sells products
in stores and online. This data is typical of what one might get from a company's marketing data base (the data base will have more data than the one we show here). This data includes 1000 customers for whom we have 3 types of data:


1. Demography
    - `age`: age of the respondent
    - `gender`: male/female
    - `house`: 0/1 variable indicating if the customer owns a house or not

1. Sales in the past year
    - `store_exp`: expense in store
    - `online_exp`: expense online
    - `store_trans`: times of store purchase
    - `online_trans`: times of online purchase

1. Survey on product preference

It is common for companies to survey their customers and draw insights to guide future marketing activities. The survey is as below:

How strongly do you agree or disagree with the following statements:

1. Strong disagree
1. Disagree
1. Neither agree nor disagree
1. Agree
1. Strongly agree

- Q1. I like to buy clothes from different brands
- Q2. I buy almost all my clothes from some of my favorite brands
- Q3. I like to buy premium brands
- Q4. Quality is the most important factor in my purchasing decision
- Q5. Style is the most important factor in my purchasing decision
- Q6. I prefer to buy clothes in store
- Q7. I prefer to buy clothes online
- Q8. Price is important 
- Q9. I like to try different styles
- Q10. I like to make a choice by myself and don't need too much of others' suggestions 

There are 4 segments of customers: 

1. Price
1. Conspicuous
1. Quality
1. Style

The simulation is not very straightforward and I will break it into three parts: 

1. Define data structure: variable names, variable distribution, customer segment names, segment size
1. Variable distribution parameters: mean and variance
1. Iterate across segments and variables. Simulate data according to specific parameters assigned

By organizing code this way, it makes easy for us to change specific parts of the simulation. For example, if we want to change the distribution of one variable, we can just change the corresponding part of the code.

Here is code to define data structure:

```r
# set a random number seed to make the process repeatable
set.seed(12345)
# define the number of observations
ncust<-1000
# create a data frmae for simulated data
seg_dat<-data.frame(id=as.factor(c(1:ncust)))
# assign the variable names
vars<-c("age","gender","income","house","store_exp","online_exp","store_trans","online_trans")
# assign distribution for each variable
vartype<-c("norm","binom","norm","binom","norm","norm","pois","pois")
# names of 4 segments
group_name<-c("Price","Conspicuous","Quality","Style")
# size of each segments
group_size<-c(250,200,200,350)
```

The next step is to define variable distribution parameters. There are 4 segments of customers and 8 parameters. Different segments correspond to different parameters. Let's store the parameters in a 4×8 matrix:


```r
# matrix for mean
mus <- matrix( c(
  # Price
  60, 0.5, 120000,0.9, 500,200,5,2,
  # Conspicuous
  40, 0.7, 200000,0.9, 5000,5000,10,10,
  # Quality
  36, 0.5, 70000, 0.4, 300, 2000,2,15,
  # Style
  25, 0.2, 90000, 0.2, 200, 2000,2,20), ncol=length(vars), byrow=TRUE)
```

```r
# matrix for variance
sds<- matrix( c(
  # Price
  3,NA,8000,NA,100,50,NA,NA,
  # Conspicuous
  5,NA,50000,NA,1000,1500,NA,NA,
  # Quality
  7,NA,10000,NA,50,200,NA,NA,
  # Style
  2,NA,5000,NA,10,500,NA,NA), ncol=length(vars), byrow=TRUE)
```

Now we are ready to simulate data using the parameters defined above:

```r
# simulate non-survey data
sim.dat<-NULL
set.seed(2016)
# loop on customer segment (i)
 for (i in seq_along(group_name)){
 
   # add this line in order to moniter the process
   cat (i, group_name[i],"\n")
 
  # create an empty matrix to store relevent data
  seg<-data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow=group_size[i], ncol=length(vars)))  
 
  # Simulate data within segment i
  for (j in seq_along(vars)){
 
    # loop on every variable (j)
    if (vartype[j]=="norm"){
      # simulate normal distribution
      seg[,j]<-rnorm(group_size[i], mean=mus[i,j], sd=sds[i,j])
    } else if (vartype[j]=="pois") {
      # simulate poisson distribution
      seg[,j]<-rpois(group_size[i], lambda=mus[i,j])
    } else if (vartype[j]=="binom"){
      # simulate binomial distribution
      seg[,j]<-rbinom(group_size[i],size=1,prob=mus[i,j])
    } else{
      # if the distribution name is not one of the above, stop and return a message
      stop ("Don't have type:",vartype[j])
    }        
  }
  sim.dat<-rbind(sim.dat,seg)
 }
```

Now let's edit the data we just simulated a little by adding tags to 0/1 binomial variables:

```r
# assign variable names
names(sim.dat)<-vars
# assign factor levels to segment variable
sim.dat$segment<-factor(rep(group_name,times=group_size))
# recode gender and house variable
sim.dat$gender<-factor(sim.dat$gender, labels=c("Female","Male"))
sim.dat$house<-factor(sim.dat$house, labels=c("No","Yes"))
# store_trans and online_trans are at least 1
sim.dat$store_trans<-sim.dat$store_trans+1
sim.dat$online_trans<-sim.dat$online_trans+1
# age is integer
sim.dat$age<-floor(sim.dat$age)
```

In the real world, the data always includes some noise such as missing, wrong imputation. So we will add some noise to the data:

```r
# add missing values
idxm <- as.logical(rbinom(ncust, size=1, prob=sim.dat$age/200))
sim.dat$income[idxm]<-NA
# add wrong imputations and outliers
set.seed(123)
idx<-sample(1:ncust,5)
sim.dat$age[idx[1]]<-300
sim.dat$store_exp[idx[2]]<- -500
sim.dat$store_exp[idx[3:5]]<-c(50000,30000,30000)
```

So far we have created part of the data. You can check it using `summary(sim.dat).' Next, we will move on to simulate survey data.

```r
# number of survey questions
nq<-10
# mean matrix for different segments 
mus2 <- matrix( c(
  # Price
 5,2,1,3,1,4,1,4,2,4,
  # Conspicuous
 1,4,5,4,4,4,4,1,4,2,
  # Quality
 5,2,3,4,3,2,4,2,3,3,
  # Style
 3,1,1,2,4,1,5,3,4,2), ncol=nq, byrow=TRUE)

# assume the variance is 0.2 for all
sd2<-0.2
sim.dat2<-NULL
set.seed(1000)
# loop for customer segment (i)
for (i in seq_along(group_name)){
  # the following line is used for checking the progress
  # cat (i, group_name[i],"\n")
  # create an empty data frame to store data
  seg<-data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow=group_size[i], ncol=nq))  
  # simulate data within segment
  for (j in 1:nq){
    # simulate normal distribution
    res<-rnorm(group_size[i], mean=mus2[i,j], sd=sd2)
    # set upper and lower limit
    res[res>5]<-5
    res[res<1]<-1
    # convert continuous values to discrete integers
    seg[,j]<-floor(res)
  }
  sim.dat2<-rbind(sim.dat2,seg)
}

names(sim.dat2)<-paste("Q",1:10,sep="")
sim.dat<-cbind(sim.dat,sim.dat2)
sim.dat$segment<-factor(rep(group_name,times=group_size))
```

So far we have gotten all the data. Let's check it:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
sim.dat <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happyrabbit/DataScientistR/master/Data/SegData.csv")
```


```{r}
str(sim.dat,vec.len=3)
```



## Customer Satisfaction Survey Data from Airline Company

We will simulate a customer satisfaction survey for three airline companies. There are `N=1000` respondents and 15 questions. The market researcher asked respondents to recall the experience with different airline companies and assign a score (1-9) to each airline company for all the 15 questions. The higher the score, the more satisfied the customer to the specific item. The 15 questions are of 4 types (the variable names are in the  parentheses):


- How satisfied are you with your______?

1. Ticketing
    - Ease of making reservation（Easy_Reservation）
    - Availability of preferred seats（Preferred_Seats）
    - Variety of flight options（Flight_Options）
    - Ticket prices（Ticket_Prices）
1. Aircraft
    - Seat comfort（Seat_Comfort）
    - Roominess of seat area（Seat_Roominess）
    - Availability of Overhead（Overhead_Storage）
    - Cleanliness of aircraft（Clean_Aircraft）
1. Service
    - Courtesy of flight attendant（Courtesy）
    - Friendliness（Friendliness）
    - Helpfulness（Helpfulness）
    - Food and drinks（Service）
1. General
    - Overall satisfaction（Satisfaction）
    - Purchase again（Fly_Again）
    - Willingness to recommend（Recommend）

```r
# Create a matrix of factor loadings
# This pattern is called bifactor because it has a general factor for separate components.
# For example, "Ease of making reservation" has general factor loading 0.33, specific factor loading 0.58
# The outcome variables are formed as combinations of these general and specific factors

loadings <- matrix(c (
  # Ticketing
  .33, .58, .00, .00,  # Ease of making reservation 
  .35, .55, .00, .00,  # Availability of preferred seats

  nrow=15,ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)
  
# Matrix multiplication produces the correlation matrix except for the diagonal
cor_matrix<-loadings %*% t(loadings)
# Diagonal set to ones
diag(cor_matrix)<-1

# use the mvtnorm package to randomly generate a data set with a given correlation pattern

library(mvtnorm)
# mean vectors of the 3 airline companies
mu1=c(5,6,5,6, 7,8,6,7, 5,5,5,5, 6,6,6)
mu2=c(3,3,2,3, 5,4,5,6, 8,8,8,8, 3,3,3)
mu3=c(2,2,2,2, 8,8,8,8, 8,8,8,8, 8,8,8)

# set random seed
set.seed(123456) 
# respondent ID
resp.id <- 1:1000 

library(MASS) 
rating1 <- mvrnorm(length(resp.id),
                     mu=mu1,
                     Sigma=cor_matrix)
rating2 <- mvrnorm(length(resp.id),
                   mu=mu2,
                   Sigma=cor_matrix)
rating3 <- mvrnorm(length(resp.id),
                   mu=mu3,
                   Sigma=cor_matrix)


# truncates scale to be between 1 and 9
rating1[rating1>9]<-9
rating1[rating1<1]<-1
rating2[rating2>9]<-9
rating2[rating2<1]<-1
rating3[rating3>9]<-9
rating3[rating3<1]<-1

# Round to single digit
rating1<-data.frame(round(rating1,0))
rating2<-data.frame(round(rating2,0))
rating3<-data.frame(round(rating3,0))
rating1$ID<-resp.id
rating2$ID<-resp.id
rating3$ID<-resp.id
rating1$Airline<-rep("AirlineCo.1",length(resp.id))
rating2$Airline<-rep("AirlineCo.2",length(resp.id))
rating3$Airline<-rep("AirlineCo.3",length(resp.id))
rating<-rbind(rating1,rating2,rating3)

# assign names to the variables in the data frame
names(rating)<-c(
  "Easy_Reservation",
  "Preferred_Seats",
  "Flight_Options",
  "Ticket_Prices",
  "Seat_Comfort",
  "Seat_Roominess",
  "Overhead_Storage",

  "Courtesy",
  "Friendliness",
  "Helpfulness",
  "Service",
  "Satisfaction",
  "Fly_Again",
  "Recommend",
  "ID",
  "Airline")
```

Now check the data frame we have:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rating<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happyrabbit/DataScientistR/master/Data/AirlineRating.csv")
```


```{r}
str(rating,vec.len=3)

## Swine Disease Breakout Data

In this section, we are going to simulate a data set about swine disease. We simulate 800 farms (i.e. n=800) and 120 survey questions (i.e. G=120) in each data set. There are
three possible answers for each question. The outbreak status for the $i^{th}$ farm is generated from a $Bernoulli(1, p_i)$ distribution with $p_i$ being a function of
the question answers: 

$$ln(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})=\beta_0 + \Sigma_{g=1}^G\mathbf{x_{i,g}^T\beta_{g}}$$

where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\mathbf{x_{i,g}}$ is a three-dimensional indication vector for question answer and $\mathbf(\beta_g)$ is the
parameter vector corresponding to the $g^{th}$ predictor. Three types of questions are
considered regarding their effects on the outcome. The first forty survey questions
are important questions such that the coefficients of the three answers to these
questions are all different:

$$\mathbf{\beta_g}=(1,0,-1)\times \gamma,\ g=1,\dots,40$$
The second forty survey questions are also important questions but only one answer
has a coefficient that is different from the other two answers:

$$\mathbf{\beta_g}=(1,0,0)\times \gamma,\ g=41,\dots,80$$

The last forty survey questions are also unimportant questions such that all three
answers have the same coefficients:

$$\mathbf{\beta_g}=(0,0,0)\times \gamma,\ g=81,\dots,120$$

The baseline coefficient $\beta_0$ is set to be $-\frac{40}{3}\gamma$ so that on average a farm have $50%$ of chance to have an outbreak. The parameter $\gamma$ in the above simulation is set to control the strength of the questions' effect on the outcome. In this simulation study, we consider the situations where $\gamma = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2$. So the parameter settings are:

$$\mathbf{\beta^{T}}=\left(\underset{question\ 1}{\frac{40}{3},\underbrace{1,0,-1}},...,\underset{question\ 40}{\underbrace{1,0,-1}},\underset{question\ 41}{\underbrace{1,0,0}},...,\underset{question\ 80}{\underbrace{1,0,0}},\underset{question\ 81}{\underbrace{0,0,0}},...,\underset{question\ 120}{\underbrace{0,0,0}}\right)*\gamma$$

For each value of $\gamma$, 20 data sets are simulated. The bigger $\gamma$ is, the larger the corresponding parameter. We provided the data sets with $\gamma = 2$. Let's check the data:

```{r}
disease_dat<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happyrabbit/DataScientistR/master/Data/sim1_da1.csv")
# only show the last 7 columns here
head(subset(disease_dat,select=c( "Q118.A","Q118.B","Q119.A","Q119.B","Q120.A","Q120.B","y"))) 
```

Here `y` indicates the outbreak situation of the farms. `y=1` means there is an outbreak in 5 years after the survey. The rest columns indicate survey responses. For example `Q120.A = 1` means the respondent chose `A` in Q120. We consider `C` as the baseline.
